## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This second programming assignment will require you to write an R function is
## able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. For example, taking the
## mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast operation. However, for a very
## long vector, it may take too long to compute the mean, especially if it has
## to be computed repeatedly (e.g. in a loop). If the contents of a vector are
## not changing, it may make sense to cache the value of the mean so that when
## we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed.
## In this Programming Assignment will take advantage of the scoping rules of
## the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside of
## an R object.

## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss
## here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse
## of a matrix.

## Write the following functions:

##      1. makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that
##         can cache its inverse.
##      2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special
##         "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already
##         been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve
##         should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function
## in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns
## its inverse.

## For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

## In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:

##      1. Fork the GitHub repository containing the stub R files at 
##         https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2 to create a copy
##         under your own account.

##      2. Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer so that you can
##         edit the files locally on your own machine.

##      3. Edit the R file contained in the git repository and place your
##         solution in that file (please do not rename the file).

##      4. Commit your completed R file into YOUR git repository and push your
##         git branch to the GitHub repository under your account.

##      5. Submit to Coursera the URL to your GitHub repository that contains
##         the completed R code for the assignment.

## In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will need
## to submit the 40 character SHA-1 hash (as string of numbers from 0-9 and
## letters from a-f) that identifies the repository commit that contains the
## version of the files you want to submit. You can do this in GitHub by doing
## the following

##      1. Going to your GitHub repository web page for this assignment

##      2. Click on the “?? commits” link where ?? is the number of commits you
##         have in the repository. For example, if you made a total of 10
##         commits to this repository, the link should say “10 commits”.

##      3. You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository.
##         The most recent commit is at the very top. If this represents the
##         version of the files you want to submit, then just click the
##         “copy to clipboard” button on the right hand side that should appear
##         when you hover over the SHA-1 hash. Paste this SHA-1 hash into the
##         course web site when you submit your assignment. If you don't want
##         to use the most recent commit, then go down and find the commit you
##         want and copy the SHA-1 hash.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" I created in the 
## above makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv
}
